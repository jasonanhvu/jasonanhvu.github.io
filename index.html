          <p class="para-prog">In high school, I was that kid that who never paid attention. Seemingly 
            in my own world of computers and headphones over my head, I've had a keyboard under my hands 
            since birth. Things never change. </p>
          <p class="para-prog">Now, as an incoming CSE student at SCU, I'll work with people through various
            stages of design:  building, coding effective algorithms, and troubleshooting potential bugs.</p>
          </p>
          <p class="para-prog">I participate in the mini-projects I do because I enjoy it. I love 
            reading articles from computing industries. I like the people I meet. I embrace the nerd 
            within because being a nerd sets the pace for making the web a better place. 
            Hopefully, we can cross paths in the real world someday, and we can make it a better 
            place for future generations. </p>
