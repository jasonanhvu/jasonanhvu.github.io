          <p class="para1">
            In high school, I was that kid that who loved to do things his own way. In my own world of computers 
            and headphones over my head, I've had a keyboard under my hands since birth. Things have never changed 
            since. Now, as an incoming CSE student at SCU, I'll work with people through various stages of design:  
            building, coding effective algorithms, and troubleshooting potential bugs. 
          </p>
          <p class="para1">
            I participate in the mini-projects I do because I enjoy it. I love reading articles from computing 
            industries. I like the people I meet. I embrace the nerd within because being a nerd sets the pace 
            for making the web a better place. Hopefully, we can cross paths in the real world someday, and 
            we can make it a better place for future generations.
